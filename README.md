[Fabric Identity](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-29mQRQys4-fabric-identity) was developed to help users identify fabric types and make informed fabric choices for various projects. When a user uploads an image of a fabric, Fabric Identity analyzes the visual characteristics—such as texture, weave, pattern, and material composition—to provide insights on what type of fabric it might be. This can be helpful for people trying to determine unknown fabrics, whether they are vintage finds, samples without labels, or unique textiles. The tool uses its understanding of fabric types to give an educated guess based on the image, although it’s not a replacement for professional lab testing or hands-on inspection.

In addition to fabric identification, Fabric Identity offers personalized recommendations for fabric selection based on the user's specific project needs. Whether the user is planning to sew clothing, upholster furniture, or create other textile-based items, Fabric Identity can suggest suitable fabrics by considering factors like durability, comfort, breathability, and aesthetic. The goal is to empower users to make fabric choices that will best meet the demands of their projects, helping them understand which materials are likely to perform well and look good in their intended use. This makes Fabric Identity an ideal tool for designers, hobbyists, and anyone working with textiles.
